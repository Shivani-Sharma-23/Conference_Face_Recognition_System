The proposed application provides a complete solution for identity authentication and access control aimed at facilitating seamless participation in meetings. Using advanced image analysis and facial recognition technology in the background, the application ensures a secure and efficient user authentication process.
The system starts the authentication process using stored wallpapers to verify the user identity. These images are stored securely and are the primary means of authentication. The app then uses the latest facial recognition technologies to match the user live facial features with authorized wallpapers. After successful verification, the user will get access to the scheduled meeting. It is simplified the procedure eliminates the need for complex login information and significantly reduces the possibilities unauthorized entry. Checking the identity of the background image and combining the face after detection, the application creates a strong and user-friendly protection method. Essentially, the program revolutionizes meeting access control by seamlessly integrating background checks with real-time facial recognition. This innovative approach ensures participant legitimacy and improves the overall meeting experience by implementing efficient and secure entry protocols.
